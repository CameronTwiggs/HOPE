## Project Notes

This is my first react project, so I am not very familiar with the framework. But I had a lot of fun working on it.
I learned so much about react and how to use it to build a website. I can confidently say that I enjoyed myself working on this project.

I also managed to help a lot of my peers~ with their projects. This boosted my learning and gave me a lot of experience that ended up really helping me out in terms of learning react.
