      <p>What is oppression and what are we up against? Oppression in its purest form is the prevention of growth against individuals or groups of people. The oppression we are battling against, however, is the oppression led by those with political power. The very same people meant to express our thoughts and ideas in the political world, are now working against us. This is an oppression that must change, and it must change now.</p>
